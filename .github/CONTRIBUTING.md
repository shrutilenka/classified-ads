## Functionalities

- Please check README

## Notes

- It is advised to install **Classified-ads** on Linux, I think you can try it on Windows or Mac if necessary.
- Problems that might occur during installation are due to these two packages `htmltidy2` and `@smodin/fast-text-language-detection` which requires `node-gyp` which is tricky. I suggest to make `python` command available and pointing to `python2.7` on your system. This command `sudo apt-get install -y build-essential && ` when you run `npm run build` also helps with `node-gyp` installation.
- Don't hesitate to open new issues about installation as well.

## Deployment


`.env` files hold secret keys and configurations which you want to hide.  
All other configurations should live in `/config/{NODE_env}.json` file.

- Install sass globally
`npm install -g sass`
-  Install webpack globally
`npm install -g webpack`
-  Create environment files
`touch /.env && /client/.env`
-  Fulfill environment variables on server (note that `localhost` is meant for easy deployment on your machine  
while `development` is meant for deployment on cloud providers (tested on Heroku))
   - NODE_ENV=localhost
   - HONEYPOT_KEY=
   - MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://### (optional for localhost env)
   - CREDS_PATH=./creds/##.json
   - GCLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET=NameOfBucket
   - JWT_SECRET=Just@Passw0rd
   - COOKIE_NAME=Just@Name
   - SECRET_PATH=Just@Passw0rd
   - PASSWORD=Just@Passw0rd
   - DEBUG=sws:*
   - REDIS_URI=127.0.0.1
   - ADMIN_PASS=PASSWORD
   - ADMIN_EMAIL=some_outlook_email@outlook.com
   - NO_CLUSTER=true
   - DEFAULT_LANG=en-US
   
-  Prepare database
MongoDB must be up with the following dbs and collections  
`DBs: {listings_db_dev, listings_db} & Collections: {listing, words, comment, userstemp, users, visitors-default-current, visitors-default}`
-  Fulfill Google Cloud credentials (for storage) (optional for localhost env)
`./creds/############.json` 
-  Change environment files accordingly
-  Verify configuration on your environments as you want here `/config`
- Build the whole project
`npm run build`
- Or don't be afraid of running commands here step by step: `sudo apt-get install -y build-essential && npm install && cd client && npm install && npm run dev:client && cd ..`

### Note

The app bootstraps for France country as an example, with a simple tweak, you could bootstrap the app on another location with a different map (I encourage you to try that).
For instance, my `/client/.env` is like:

```
LATITUDE=36.75
LONGITUDE=3.05
BORDERS_FILE_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bacloud22/Classified-ads-xx-data/main/data/geo/simple_fr.geojson
STATES_FILE_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bacloud22/Classified-ads-xx-data/main/data/geo/states.min.json
```
With a center (LATITUDE, LONGITUDE) and a map. Check [here](https://github.com/bacloud22/Classified-ads-xx-data) or elsewhere for more geoJson data.

With a different geoJSON data, you might need to change encoders in both files `/data/geo/geoJSONEncoder.js` and `/client/data/geo/geoJSONEncoder.js`.

## Finally

- **Contribution is VERY WELCOME, I already thank you in advance. This project needs you, I passed literally a year on this, knowing I'm your average developer, another one would take way less time.**

- **Deploying it elsewhere is fine for non-commercial uses (see license), but please, consider to contribute to this main project pushing everything you find important: a new functionality, a bug or security fix, better design...**

- **I will be very active with pull requests (testing and approving) but less active on resolving raised issue. With this being said, I really appreciate new issues raised after a proper installation and tests.**

- **The app is full of bugs ! I know.**

- **There are dozens of TODOs I leave in code. You can pick one and help the project! Some are left for you to customize depending on your preferences.**


- We rely on dozens of open sources projects particularly for front-end particularly. These are lightweight, minimal and safe libraries. Some examples are: 

  * pell: üìù the simplest and smallest WYSIWYG text editor for web, with no dependencies [repo](https://github.com/jaredreich/pell)
  * tagify: üîñ lightweight, efficient Tags input component in Vanilla JS / React / Angular / Vue  [repo](https://github.com/yairEO/tagify)
  * notyf: üëª A minimalistic, responsive, vanilla JavaScript library to show toast notifications [repo](https://github.com/caroso1222/notyf)
  * holmes: Fast and easy searching inside a page [repo](https://github.com/Haroenv/holmes) It uses microlight also.
  * auto-complete:  An extremely lightweight and powerful vanilla JavaScript completion suggester. [repo](https://github.com/Pixabay/JavaScript-autoComplete)
  * jsi18n: Simple client side internationalization with javascript. [repo](https://github.com/danabr/jsI18n) 
  * avatar: Library for showing Gravatars or generating user avatars. [repo](https://github.com/MatthewCallis/avatar) 
  * FontPicker: Font selector component for Google Fonts . [repo](https://github.com/samuelmeuli/font-picker)

    This raises multiple challenges mainly for upgrading and actively maintained from their authors. We would like to rely always on the latest versions but we would change one library by another if the project seems inactive or very old (like not supporting modules or so).
    Leaflet particularly is the most important in this regard.

    I don't know much yet about versioning in npm, although [it is very very important](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning). I suggest to install [ndm](https://720kb.github.io/ndm/) and add two projects `./` and `./client/` to have an eye on last versions and what to expect.


### Pull requests

- Merging the same code with different indentations is hell, so it is important to keep one coding style between forks. I suggest to install [VSCode ESlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) (Prettier also) that connects automatically with `./eslintrc.js` and `./client/./eslintrc.js`. 
    - "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"
    - "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
