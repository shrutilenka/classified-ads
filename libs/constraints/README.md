# Constraints

Are conditions to enforce the whole application to. Instead of writing complex `if-else` and `switch` blocks everywhere, we use `JSON` instead.

It also contains data models to avoid logical errors. If a user posts a listing, MongoDB never complains since it is No-SQL, but the app itself might become inconsitant with our initial goals. Hence, the data models.
